# HouseDesign-Software

I worked with 4 group members at uni to design the UI for a house decoration app using Proto.io.

The software aims to increase client involvements in designing their own homes with a professional house design company, by encouraging clients to build their own scrapbooks, providing a variety of home design options, and allowing clients to decorate their houses using the 3D models/VR technology.

To view the mobile app, download https://github.com/yvoxu/HouseDesign-Software/blob/master/House-Design-Mobile.html and open it on your local machine.
