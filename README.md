# HouseDesign-Software
(group project) Desian for a virtual house design company.

This is the house decoration software UI I designed with 4 other group members using Proto.io.

This repository only contains my share of work.

It aims to increase the client involvement in designing their own home with a professional house design company. By encouraging client to build their own scrapbooks, providing a variety of home design options, and allowing the client to decorate their house using 3D models/VR technology.
